ABOUT ME 
-
Currently a programmer for TI, I've been coding since late 2019 when I was bored one day and ever since then I just keep trying to improve my code. As of now im mostly doing commissions for TI but in the little spare time that I manage to have I like to play rhythm games (mostly vsrg's like Etterna and Quaver), Modded Terraria and im now starting to pick up drawing again.
